Dataset Preparation: Prepare your dataset by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring that it's ready for model training.

Feature Subset Search Space: Define the space of possible feature subsets that you want to evaluate. This can range from individual features to combinations of features.

Choose a Model: Select a machine learning algorithm that is suitable for regression tasks, such as predicting house prices. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc.

Cross-Validation: Divide your dataset into training and validation/test sets using techniques like k-fold cross-validation. This helps you avoid overfitting and provides a more accurate assessment of model performance.

Feature Subset Evaluation: Start with an initial subset of features or individual features. Train the chosen model on the training data using the selected subset and evaluate its performance on the validation/test data using an appropriate metric like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.

Iterate Through Subsets: Iterate through different combinations of features, adding or removing one feature at a time. For each combination, train the model and evaluate its performance. Keep track of the best-performing feature subset.

Model Evaluation: For each feature subset, measure its performance on the validation/test data using the chosen metric. The goal is to find a feature subset that produces the best predictive performance.

Select Best Subset: Once you've evaluated all possible feature subsets, select the one that resulted in the best performance on the validation/test data.

Final Model Training: Train the final model using the best feature subset on the entire dataset (or a larger portion of it). This model should be ready for deployment and can be used to predict house prices.

Interpret and Validate: Interpret the selected feature subset to understand which features are the most important predictors of house prices. You can also validate the model's performance on new, unseen data to ensure its generalization capabilities.
